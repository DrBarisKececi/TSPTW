The excel file contains a table with 10 columns.
Column - 1 : The model name used to solve the instance.
Column - 2 : The data set of instances.
Column - 3 : The name of instance.
Column - 4 : The number of nodes in the instance.
Column - 5 : The number of travellers (m=1 for TSPTW) in the instance.
Column - 6 : The optimal objective function value of linearly relaxed model.
Column - 7 : The best objective function value of integer feasible solution found so far within 7200 seconds. It may be optimal.
Column - 8 : The Best lower bound refers to the tightest (highest) lower bound found so far for the minimization problem across all active nodes in the branch-and-cut tree. It represents the best possible value that the optimal solution can achieve, based on the relaxations solved so far.
Column - 9 : The percentage gap between the BestOBJ and BestLB.
Column - 10 : The solution time in seconds.
